## Tools Used
<li><b>MySQL:</b> For storing and querying sales data.</li>
<li><b>Excel:</b> For initial data cleaning and preparation.</li>
<li><b>Power BI:</b> For data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).</li>

## Data Sources
<li><b>MySQL Database:</b> Contains sales data with columns including date, product, location, sales amount, quantity sold, order ID, etc.</li>
<li><b>Excel Files:</b> Used for additional data preparation and cleaning tasks.</li>

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Data cleaning was performed in Excel and transform into power bi power query to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### Excel
<li><b>Changing Data Types:</b> Ensured that numeric columns (e.g., sales amount, quantity sold, order ID) were set to appropriate numeric data types.</li>
<li><b>Replacing Null Values:</b> Applied methods such as filling with mean/median for numeric fields.</li>
<li><b>Formatting Cells:</b> Ensured proper formatting for columns, such as setting number formats with appropriate decimal places.</li>
<li><b>Handling Missing Values:</b> Used Excel functions to fill or remove missing data.</li>
<li><b>Categorizing Products and Locations:</b> Ensured consistent labeling for products and locations.</li>
<li><b>Standardizing Date Formats:</b> Used Excel functions to convert date columns to a consistent format.</li>

### Power BI
<li><b>Data Modeling:</b> Created a date table and connected it with the transaction table using the date column as the common key. This allows for time-based analysis and filtering in the dashboard.</li>
<li><b>Conditional Formatting:</b> Used conditional formatting to highlight important data points and trends in the visualizations.</li>
<li><b>Data Validation:</b> Implemented data validation rules to ensure data quality and accuracy.</li>
<li><b>Data Transformation:</b> Utilized Power Query Editor to perform data cleaning operations such as removing duplicates, filtering rows, and transforming data types.</li>

### MySql & DAX
Utilized MySql and DAX to make measures and calculations for Total sales, Total orders, Total quantity sold, Sales analysis by weekdays and weekends, Sales analysis by store location, Daily sales with average line, Sales analysis by product category, Sales analysis by days and hours.

## Visualization Used in Power BI
<li><b>Total Sales Analysis:</b> Card and line chart to visualize total sales over different time periods.</li>
<li><b>Total Order Analysis:</b> Card and line chart to show the number of orders over different time periods.</li>

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<li>What are the total sales and sales trends over different time periods?</li>
<li>How do the total orders and quantity sold vary over time?</li>
<li>What are the sales patterns on weekdays versus weekends?</li>
<li>How does sales performance vary across different store locations?</li>
<li>What are the daily sales trends, and how do they compare to the average sales?</li>
<li>Which product categories contribute the most to sales?</li>
<li>Which are the top 10 products by sales?</li>
<li>How does sales performance vary by days and hours?</li>
